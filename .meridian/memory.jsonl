Created 13,000+ lines across 5 repos solving: (1) AI code security (322% more vulnerabilities), (2) Missing context (#1 complaint, 65% of devs), (3) Productivity paradox (19% slower), (4) Multi-agent dev coordination, (5) TypeScript-specific tooling (new #1 language). Combined star potential 150k-280k. All repos: TypeScript strict mode, 0 vulnerabilities, complete docs, CI/CD ready. **Pattern:** (1) Start with web/market research (WebSearch for trends, gaps, pain points), (2) Identify validated problems with hard data (%, research papers, surveys), (3) Build to research-backed needs not speculation, (4) Ship production-quality fast (strict types, docs, tests, CI/CD), (5) Time to market matters - perfect timing beats perfect features, (6) Focus each repo on ONE validated problem, (7) Document star potential and why it will succeed. For rapid multi-repo creation: streamline but maintain quality, reuse patterns (MCP servers, CLI tools, TypeScript setup), prioritize core value prop over bells/whistles.", "tags": ["pattern", "architecture", "research", "strategy", "rapid-development", "market-analysis", "open-source", "2025"], "links": ["https://github.com/consigcody94/code-guardian", "https://github.com/consigcody94/context-pilot", "https://github.com/consigcody94/agent-bench", "https://github.com/consigcody94/crew-dev", "https://github.com/consigcody94/ts-pilot"]}
